This branch includes the most comprehensive programming projects I have completed as part of my 100 days of code challenge. Although the repository was built across a longer timeframe, I did do 100 separate projects across the branches in the repository. 

The most interesting, advanced, and difficult projects to build where the software development was done completely independently is located in this branch of the repository. 

This branch in particular will be updated since the nature of many of these projects can be improved upon via an iterative approach. All portfolio projects will include a description underneath. 

Please connect with me on LinkedIn if you have any questions, suggestions, and want to collaborate to build something cool!
