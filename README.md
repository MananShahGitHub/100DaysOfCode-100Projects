This branch showcases the most comprehensive programming projects I completed as part of my "100 Days of Code" challenge. Although the repository spanned a longer timeframe, it contains 100 distinct projects distributed across various branches.

The projects featured in this branch represent my most advanced, interesting, and challenging work, all developed independently. I am committed to continuously improving these projects through an iterative approach, ensuring each portfolio piece is refined over time.

Each project is accompanied by a detailed description to provide insights into its development process and functionality.

I am always open to feedback, suggestions, and opportunities for collaboration. Letâ€™s connect and explore possibilities to create something innovative!
